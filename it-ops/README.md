# Finblox: AWS infrastructure as code

For this project, you will be setting AWS infrastructure with Terraform. 
The setup will include:

* EKS cluster with ability to create ingresses that are available from outside
* Set of SQS instances to be used by the application which would be deployed in EKS
* RDS Postgresql to be used by the application which would be deployed in EKS

You may work using all the tools and reference materials that you usually use. You may use any 3rd party libraries, but please be ready to justify their usage and explain their inner workings. When you're done, zip up your project directory and share it with us.

Please don't spend more than 3-5 hours on this project.

## Requirements

* Repository with Terraform code and documentation how to use it (e.i. how can anyone apply it on the fresh AWS account)
* Demonstrated approaches on:
    * Security and data protection
    * Networking and VPC setup
    * Secrets management  

## Expectations

We would like to see:
* Idiomatic code and ability to explain code without documenting each line
* Use of any architecture/state management approach you're familiar with. 
* Reasonable level of documentation
